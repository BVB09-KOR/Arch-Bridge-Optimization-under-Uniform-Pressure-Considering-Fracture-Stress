Arch Bridge Optimization under Uniform Pressure Considering Fracture Stress - Reliability-Based Design Optimization (RBDO)

In the class “Probabilistic Engineering Analysis and Design” led by professor Youn, three important issues encountered in practical engineering fields were covered: Reliability assessment, Reliability-based design, and Reliability management. Thanks to his instruction, we could handle a practical optimization of design variables using Design Optimization (DO) and Reliability-Based Design Optimization (RBDO) for a uniform distributed load on an arch bridge. We formulate the constrained optimization problem defined for this problem and perform finite element method (FEM) with COMSOL. This report mainly consists of four different parts: Problem statement, Reliability analysis, Reliability analysis for initial design and DO, and Reliability-Based Design Optimization. 
At first, a description and a motivation of this project problem is given. Then a Monte Carlo Simulation, a First-order Reliability Method, a Second-order Reliability Method, and a Reliability Index Approach are performed to quantitatively evaluate the reliability of the initial design and DO. 

The code is made with Matlab
